# C++ Optimal Binary Search Tree
This program recieves an input file, with the first line containing the number of elements, and each line thereafter containing the number of times that element is searched.
It then generates an optimal binary search tree for the given keys and number of times each key is searched.
The program outputs the dynamic programming table (both values and roots), and an optimal binary search tree.
The pseudocode function from the textbook for creating the binary search tree was used
